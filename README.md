## Welcome 

I created this page to journal about my journey toward becoming a Tezos blockchain developer. The dot tk top-level domain is for Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand. I used it because it was free and available; unbelievable. But, TK is also used by editors to indicate that more material is "to come" and will be added at a later time. So it is appropriate to use here. One can always find meaning if you look hard enough.

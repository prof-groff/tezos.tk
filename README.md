## Welcome 

I created this page to journal about my journey toward becoming a Tezos blockchain developer. The dot tk top-level domain is for Tokelau, a territory of New Zealand. I used it because it was free and available; unbelievable. But, TK is also used by editors to indicate that more material is "to come" and will be added at a later time. So it is appropriate to use here. One can always find meaning if you look hard enough.

* The best all-around introduction to Tezos I've found is [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08458.pdf) by Victor Allombert, Mathias Bourgoin, and Julien Tesson from Nomadic Labs.

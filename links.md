* **Tezos Developers Portal** - The [official Tezos developer page](https://developers.tezos.com/) indexes a ton of valuable resources. I've spent the most time drilling down into the resources related to SmartPy and Michelson.
* **Best All-Around Introduction to Tezos** - [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.08458.pdf) by Victor Allombert, Mathias Bourgoin, and Julien Tesson from Nomadic Labs is a better introduction than the [Tezos whitepaper](https://tezos.com/static/white_paper-2dc8c02267a8fb86bd67a108199441bf.pdf).
* **A Good Book on Blockchain Theory** - [Mastering Blockchain](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Blockchain-distributed-consensus-cryptocurrencies/dp/1839213191) by Imran Bashir is a pretty good overview of blockchain basics with a focus on Bitcoin and Etherium. It is on the technical side but not in a good way if that makes any sense. There is a lot of jargon and figures that don't have much utility if you are uninitiated in cryptography, P2P networks, ecetra. But overall it taught me a lot.
*  **Best Introduction to Michelson** - Michelson is the language of smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain. If you have never worked with opcode or stack-based computer programming before it is going to be strange at first. [These Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/baking-bad/michelson-labs) by Baking Bad run on a Michelson Kernel and are the best introduciton to Michelson I've found. Of course, I have extensive experience with Jupyter (using Python) so that helped.
